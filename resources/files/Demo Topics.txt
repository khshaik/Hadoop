Problem description
Hadoop explanation
Demo
What’s in it for Planon


Problem: Table Comparison
--------
Data on web growing enormously causing problems: Storage, Processing => Complexity
a. Variety
b. Volume
c. Velocity 
d. Speed 
e. Transfer rate
f. Scale
c. Meaningful extracts

Survival of the fittest: Best informed decisions based on past histroical trends

Cloudera, Teraddata, HortonWorks.

Hadoop:
-------
Data grows so large in terms of peta bytes than it can't be stored and processed in 
single system. Scale out using commodity hardware to meet both storage and processing
requirements.

Inception

Components - HDFS, MapReduce (Namenode, Secondary Namenode, Datanode, Jobtracker, Tasktracker)

Features:
---------
a. Offline batch processing instead of online transactions.
b. Moving code to data.
c. Scale-out instead of Scale-up : Cost-effective scalability using commodity hardware. 
d. Key/Value pairs instead of Relational tables
e. File-based where clients can mostly append data to existing files.
g. Write once read many access-model.
h. Replication - Fault tolerant


Not a replacement for RDBMS, DW - Table Comparison.
HBase, Hive, Pig, Zookeeper, Mahout.

Usage of Hadoop in the Enterprise:
-----------------------------------
a. Store daily logs using Flume/ Chukwa
b. Process data extracted from datawarehouse/ database.
c. Pushing system log messages into HDFS – Flume, Chukwa, Scribe.
d. An automated mechanism to copy files into HDFS. Automate the process by which files on remote servers are copied into HDFS - File Slurper.
e. Scheduling regular ingress activities – Oozie.
f. Database ingress with MapReduce.
 

Demo:
-----
Anagram wordcount

Comparison with normal java program.

Whats in it for Planon
-----------------------:
a. Sqoop to export data from MSSQL/ Oracle and process the data in Hadoop.
b. MapReduce program to export and process the data.
